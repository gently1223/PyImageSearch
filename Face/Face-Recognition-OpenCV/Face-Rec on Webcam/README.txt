Run "recognize.py", it will perform these step automatically:
+ load data to train from "imgdb" folder, press enter after each successfull subset
+ create trained dataset and output file "train_result.out" so that you can fast detect later by running "recognize.py" without retraining same data again
+ open webcam for detection process
